				This is a place that I will eventually put an introductory paragraph and there will be stuffs like new lines and blah blah blah blah blash blah.

				I am writing to you today to notify you of my interest in your program, wwwwwwww.  I am a junior at Seattle University, working towards a Bachelors Degree in Mathematics with an emphasis on applied mathematics. I have an interest specifically in partial differential equations and am currently researching the Unified Transform Method through a grant awarded to me by the Center of Undergraduate Research in Mathematics. I was also invited and am attending a reading group held at the University of Washington as part of a nonlinear waves research group with

				<p>I first began to learn about PDE’s last spring through an introductory course in Fourier analysis and became quite taken with the subject. Since then, I’ve wanted to learn more about the topic, especially with boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, and now the Unified Transform method. To motivate further research, I’ve started to take more courses to assist me in studying these topics, such as introductions to numerical analysis and real analysis that I’m currently enrolled in and a courses on complex analysis that I took this last semester as well. I was also a member of a water waves reading group at Seattle University this last spring. While I have begun to delve into the unified transform method and a few other topics, PDEs as a whole are still largely unknown to me. I’m interested in what other focuses of study there are for PDEs and what current research areas are concerned with.

				As I approach the end of my junior year, I still haven’t made up my mind as to whether or not I will apply for graduate school. I do find my classes and the topic of my research interesting, but I don’t feel like I know enough about graduate school to make my decision yet. Your program, wwwwwwww, seems to be a fantastic opportunity to not only learn more about a subject I’m invested in, but also to better understand the research and atmosphere involved with a graduate program.
